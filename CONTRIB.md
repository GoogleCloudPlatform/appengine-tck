# How to become a contributor and submit your own code

## Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your tests and patches! Before we can take them, we
have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement
(CLA).

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA]
    (https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual).
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
    then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA]
    (https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to
accept your pull requests.

## Contributing A Test or Patch

1. If you have not done so already, sign a
   Contributor License Agreement (see details above).
1. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
1. Ensure that your code adheres to the existing style in the test to which
   you are contributing. Refer to the
   [Google Cloud Platform Samples Style Guide]
   (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/Template/wiki/style.html) for the
   recommended coding standards for this organization.
1. For non-test submissions ensure that your code has an appropriate set of
   unit tests which all pass.
1. Submit a pull request.
