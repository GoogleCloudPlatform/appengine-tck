# List the appengine classes that require test coverage information.
# To run coverage go to the base tck directory with the parent pom,
# and run $ mvn clean install  A coverage report will be located in the
# relative test directory as index.html.
#
# For example, if we wanted to see which appengine methods were called
# in the taskqueue DeferredTask class and DeferredTaskCreationException class,
# you would specify the following (without the comment marker '#')
#
# com.google.appengine.api.taskqueue.DeferredTask
# com.google.appengine.api.taskqueue.DeferredTaskCreationException
